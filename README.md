### NOTES:
- This version of PatchRecoveryRevived is heavily based on [Ravindu's Patch-Recovery-Revived](https://github.com/ravindu644/patch-recovery-revived) and this is just a simplified version of it.
- The patches are tested but the script is not tested because i don't have time to work much on development. Feel free to try it out if interested! Thank you.
